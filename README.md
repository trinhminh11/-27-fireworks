The Coverage Problem in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) refers to the task of deploying a limited number of sensors in an area to ensure that the entire region is adequately covered by the sensors. The goal is to maximize the coverage quality while minimizing the number of sensors deployed or optimizing other related factors such as energy consumption or connectivity.

The Connectivity Problem in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) deals with establishing and maintaining communication among the sensor nodes in the network. The objective is to ensure that all nodes in the network can communicate with each other, either directly or indirectly, to support data gathering, information exchange, and network coordination. The Connectivity Problem is crucial for the proper functioning and performance of WSNs.
